# Games prototypes on Unity Engine

- Object Wheels - 2d game for smartphones (fully ported to Java under Android Studio). You have two cards  that containing different pictures. You should find in the minimal time the picture that contained on both cards;
- MMO cars - 3d online race game for PC with open world like "The Crew" and "Burnout paradise" (in perspective
). Used Photon server for multiplayer. Very early concept;
- Time quest - logical isometric game based on time traveling (met the ruined bridge - returned to the past and easy passed through it, etc).Source code is lost (maybe).
